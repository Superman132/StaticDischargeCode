This is the FTC code for Team #11172 Static Discharge

contributors:
    Yash Gupta ( lead programmer and person who wrote 99% of the code in this repository)
    William Shilling (now on team Patent Pending, wrote some earlier parts of the hardware directory)


I am working to get more members involved in the code. I am also interested in talking to other teams to see if they like the software I have written.
If they like the code, I may release this as a library for FTC development.
